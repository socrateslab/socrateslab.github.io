计算传播学实验中心主任巢乃鹏老师关于中国网民政治认知的研究2016年发表于Telematics and Informatics。作为一个SSCI索引的重要期刊，[Telematics and Informatics](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/telematics-and-informatics)的影响因子2015年为2.261，主要发表分析信息和传播技术在社会、政治、经济、政治和文化多个维度影响力的实证研究。

这个研究采用问卷调查的方法，分析了中国网民在因特网生态认知、政治信任、政治效能等方面的模式。研究发现中国网民的言论尺度和政治参与方式在很大程度上依赖于其对中国互联网生态的认知，后者对于网民的政治信任和外部政治效能具有显著影响，而政治信任对于内部和外部政治效能均具有显著影响。

## Abstract

Political efficacy is an important indicator of political democracy. As the Internet, especially social media, has grown and evolved, it has greatly changed the Chinese public’s political perceptions. Chinese Internet governance has shifted the mode of “vague governance” and “subsequent punishment” from traditional political governance into the Internet ecology. Chinese citizens’ speech criteria and means of political participation depend largely on their perceptions of the political ecology. Based on a questionnaire survey conducted in Jiangsu Province (N = 1558) in 2013, this paper discusses the impact of Internet ecological perception and political trust on netizens’ political efficacy. The results show that netizens’ perceptions of Internet ecology had significantly positive effects on external political efficacy but no significant effects on internal political efficacy. Netizens’ perceptions of Internet ecology positively affected their political trust, which in turn had significant, positive effects on both internal and external political efficacies.
